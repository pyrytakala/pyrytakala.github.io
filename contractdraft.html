The Employee undertakes to notify the Employer immediately if any such right ceases, or is reasonably expected to cease during his employment and to immediately provide the Employer with written details of changes to his/her personal circumstances that might affect his/her immigration permission.
<p>In order for the Employer to comply with its duties to prevent illegal working, if the Employee is a sponsored migrant under the Points Based System, the Employee is required to notify the Employer in writing within five working days of any change in the Employee's personal contact details (home address, home telephone number and mobile telephone number).
<p>The Employee undertakes to provide on request, and if necessary at least once in every 12 month period, the Employee's original passport and other satisfactory documentary evidence of his/her right to work in the UK.

<span id="optionSentence2"></span>

<h2>Other Benefits</h2>
<p>In addition to the above remuneration the Employee shall be entitled to:
<ol type="a">
	<li> <span id="holidayDays"</span> holiday (vacation) days per year, as well as the usual UK public holidays.  To the extent that any of the benefits offered to you in your employment package constitute taxable income you will be responsible for all related tax liabilities. (See section 12)
</ol>
<p>For part-time employees, entitlement to holidays, sick pay, and all other benefits is pro rata based on the hours worked compared to those worked by a full time employee.
<p>To the extent that any of the benefits are taxable the Employee will be responsible for all those liabilities.
<br>
<p>A contracting out certificate is not in force in respect of the employment.
<br>
<p>Participation in any insurance-based benefit (including Private Medical Insurance, Death in Service and PHI) is subject to the terms and conditions from time to time in force, is conditional on the Employee satisfying any applicable requirements of the insurer and being accepted at normal rates of premium.

<p>The Employer reserves the right to amend, alter or cease to provide (without compensation) any benefit (including any commission plan or incentive based pay) at any time.
<p>Nothing in this agreement shall constrain or prevent the Employer from terminating the Employee's employment, notwithstanding that the Employee is or may be entitled to receive benefit payments or other benefits under any PHI Scheme from time to time in force.

<h2>Place of Work</h2>
<p>The Employee's primary place of work will be the company's office or such other place within London.

<p>The normal working hours of the Employee will be from 8:30a.m. to 5:30p.m. on Mondays to Fridays.  The Employee will be entitled to an hour's lunch break during each working day. The hours are flexible, and the Employee and the Employer can mutually agree different working hours from week to week.

The Employee may terminate his/her agreement to this provision by giving three months' notice in writing.

<h2>Holidays</h2>
<p><b>Annual Holidays</b>
<p>The Employee's annual paid holiday entitlement is <span id="holidayDays"</span> working days in each holiday year.  Holiday entitlement will accrue pro-rata to each completed month of employment.
<p>The Employee is required to submit a holiday request form to his/her Line Manager for approval for all periods of leave.
<p>The holiday year runs from January 1 to December 31.
<p>It is not permitted to carry forward holiday entitlement from one holiday year to the next nor will payments in lieu be made in respect of holiday not taken in the relevant holiday year.
<p>The Employee must ensure that there is no unnecessary overlapping with the holidays of other staff who would be responsible for the Employee's duties whilst he/she is on holiday.
<p>Holiday pay on termination of employment will be calculated by establishing the number of days holiday accrued in the holiday year up to the date of termination and subtracting from this the number of days taken during the current holiday year.  The number of days remaining, if any, will be paid.
<p><b>Bank Holidays and Public Holidays</b>
<p>In addition to annual holidays the Employee shall be entitled to paid holidays on all statutory and public holidays together with any additional holidays awarded by the Employer.

<h2>Sickness or Injury</h2>
<ol type="a">
	<li>If the Employee is absent from work due to sickness, he/she may be entitled to statutory sick pay.  Any other payment will be at the discretion of the Employer.
	<li>If the Employee is prevented by sickness from performing his/her duties properly, he/she shall report this fact promptly to his/her manager before 10.00 a.m. on the first day of sickness together with an estimate of the period of absence envisaged.  Any change in the estimated period of absence must be notified as soon as possible.
		<p>If the absence continues for more than 3 continuous working days a "fit-note" from the Employee's doctor should be submitted explaining the nature of the sickness or injury.

		<p>During all periods of absence due to sickness or injury the Employee should keep the Employer informed as to his/her likely date of return.

		<p>A Form SC2 (Self Certification of Sickness) is required in all cases of uncertified sickness.

<li>If the Employee is absent for more than 12 weeks in any 12-month period due to sickness or injury then the Employer is entitled to terminate the employment.
</ol>

<h2>Maternity Leave/Maternity Pay/Parental Leave/Paternity Leave</h2>
<p>Employees with the requisite period of service will, if pregnant, be entitled to statutory maternity pay and statutory maternity leave.
<p>Employees with the requisite period of service may be entitled to statutory parental leave and/or paternity leave.
<p>Full details of the relevant regulations and entitlements may be obtained on request.

<h2>Health and Safety</h2>
<p>The Employee is bound to comply with the duties imposed by the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 or any substitution thereof or amendment or alteration thereto ("the Act") and the Health and Safety Regulations made or to be made under the Act and in particular with the duties set out under section 7 of the Act which require an employee to:
<ol type="a">
	<li>take reasonable care for the health and safety of him or herself and of others who may be affected by his/her acts or omissions at work;
	<li>as regards any duty imposed on the Employer or any other person, co-operate with the Employer so far as is necessary to enable that duty to be performed or complied with.
</ol>

<h2>Grievance Procedure</h2>
<p>It is expected that most grievances may be resolved informally.  However, if the Employee wishes to raise a formal grievance relating to his/her employment he/she should raise it in the first instance in writing with his/her Line Manager setting out the nature of the grievance.  The Line Manager will then invite the Employee to a hearing to discuss the grievance. The hearing will be scheduled to allow time for the Employer to consider the issues raised.  After the meeting, the Employer will inform the Employee of the decision and of his/her right to appeal.

<p>If the grievance is not satisfactorily resolved in this way then the Employee should appeal the matter in writing to a Director of Employer.  The Director will invite the Employee to an appeal hearing, following which the Director shall communicate that decision in writing to the Employee.  The decision of the Director shall be final.
<p>This policy does not form part of the contract of employment, save and only to the extent expressly required by law. If the Employee wishes, he/she may be accompanied at either or both hearings by a colleague or trade union official.

<h2>Summary Dismissal</h2>
<ol type="a">
	<li>In the following circumstances, which are intended by way of example only of what may be regarded as gross misconduct, and not by way of a complete list, the Employee will be dismissed summarily by written notice to operate from the date of such notice and the Employee will not be entitled to any further payment under his/her terms of employment except such sum as has accrued and is due at the date of termination:
	<ol type="i">
		<li>refusing to carry out any proper direction given in the course of the employment;
		<li>improperly divulging to any third party any confidential or non-public information regarding the Employer, its employees or any person with whom the Employer deals;
		<li>committing any act or divulging any information which is contrary to or damages the interests or objectives of the Employer;
		<li>committing any criminal offence which in the opinion of the Employer makes the Employee unsuitable for the type of work that the Employee is employed to do or may reasonably be expected to do or which makes him/her unacceptable to other employees;
		<li>dishonest conduct;
		<li>violent, obscene or abusive behaviour towards other employees or officers of the Employer;
		<li>serious or wilful breach of the Employee's duties;
		<li>if the warranties given by the Employee at clause 4 are found to be misleading or incorrect; or
		<li>attending the Employer's premises or engaging in the Employer's business whilst under the influence of alcohol or unlawful drugs.
	</ol>
	<li>Any other serious or irreparable act or omission by the Employee may be regarded as gross misconduct where such act or omission is, in the reasonable opinion of the Employer likely to (or has) cause(d) serious harm to the business or reputation of the Employer.
</ol>

<h2>Disciplinary Procedure</h2>
<ol type="a">
	<li>This disciplinary procedure does not form part of the Employee's contract of employment (save and only to the extent that it may from time to time be required to do so by law).  The Employer accepts that it is in the interests of good relations with its staff to ensure that there is a fair and proper disciplinary procedure.
	<li>Any Employee who departs from normally expected standards or who violates the Employer's rules will be liable to disciplinary action.
	<li>If disciplinary action which may lead to disciplinary measures is to be taken against the Employee (other than suspension under (d) and (e) below or issuing of a warning - where modified procedures may apply), the following procedure will normally apply. The Employee will receive a letter setting out the alleged conduct or other circumstances and inviting the Employee to attend a disciplinary hearing. The hearing will be set at a time and date to allow the Employee time to consider the allegations against him/her.  At the disciplinary hearing (which the Employee must take all reasonable steps to attend) the Employee will be given the opportunity to respond to the issues raised.  The decision on the hearing will be notified to the Employee after the hearing, along with details of the right to appeal. The Employee will have the right to be accompanied to any disciplinary hearing and subsequent appeal by a colleague or trade union official.
	<li>The Employer reserves the right to suspend the Employee on full pay pending investigation where the Employer has reasonable grounds to believe that the Employee's continued employment might be prejudicial to the Employer's business or other employees.
	<li>The Employer reserves the right to suspend the Employee without pay and benefits as a disciplinary measure.
	<li>Disciplinary action will vary in accordance with the seriousness of the Employee's offence.  Minor instances of wrongdoing may result in a verbal or written warning. More serious offences or repeated infringements may result in a final written warning. The most serious offences or repeated infringements following a final written warning may result in dismissal with or without notice.
	<li>The Employee may appeal against any disciplinary action taken to a Company Director. The Employee will then be invited to attend an appeal hearing (and must take all reasonable steps to do so).  Following any such appeal, the Employee will be informed of the outcome.
</ol>

<h2>Sexual Harassment</h2>
<p>True AI Ltd. considers that sexual harassment in the workplace is unacceptable and will treat all complaints seriously.
<p>An Employee who feels that he/she has been subjected to sexual harassment should raise the matter with his/her Line Manager under the terms of the grievance procedure set out in the corresponding clause above.
<p>An Employee who is found to be the perpetrator of harassment will be liable to disciplinary action under the terms of the disciplinary procedure set out in the corresponding clause above.  The Employer may exercise its discretion as to the disciplinary measures which will be taken, depending on the nature of the conduct.

<h2>Data Protection</h2>
<p>The Employee agrees that personal data relating to the Employee (including sensitive personal data such as medical details) may to the extent that it is reasonably necessary in connection with the Employee's employment or the business of the Employer:
<ol type="a">
	<li>be collected and held (in hard copy and computer readable form) and processed by the Employer; and
	<li>be disclosed to:
	<ol type="i">
		<li>other employees of the Employer and the Employer's group companies;
		<li>any other persons as may be reasonably necessary (such as third party benefit providers or administrators) or as authorised by the Employee; or
		<li>as otherwise required or permitted by law.
	</ol>
</ol>
<p>This consent applies regardless of the country to which the data is to be transferred.  Where the disclosure or transfer is to a destination outside the European Economic Area, the Employer shall take reasonable steps to ensure that the Employee's personal data continues to be adequately protected, though the Employee may no longer have rights under data protection law.
<p>If the Employee has any queries regarding the Employee's personal data, these should be raised with the Line Manager.

<h2>Deductions</h2>
<p>The Employee consents to the deduction from any sum otherwise payable to the Employee by reason of his/her employment (or its termination) the value of any claim of whatever nature and in whatever capacity that the Employer may bona fide have against the Employee, including but not limited to:
<ol type="a">
	<li>overpayment of wages;
	<li>overpayment in respect of expenses incurred by the Employee in carrying out his/her duties;
	<li>loans which the Employer may from time to time make to the Employee; and
	<li>advances on wages which the Employer may from time to time make to the Employee.
</ol>
<p>The Employee further consents that the Employer has the right to deduct from the employee's salary or other sums due to the Employee a sum in respect of accrued holiday entitlement if at the date of termination of the Employee's employment he/she has taken in excess of his/her accrued holiday entitlement.

<h2>Choice of Law</h2>
<p>This contract shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of England and Wales and each party to this agreement submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts and tribunals of England and Wales.
